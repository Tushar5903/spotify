It features an intuitive user interface with a left sidebar for navigation and a right section for displaying available albums along with a fully interactive music player. The project is designed to mimic key aspects of Spotify's experience while remaining lightweight and easy to use.

## Technologies Used

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. Ensure that a **local server is running** (e.g., using Live Server in VS Code for seamless playback).
4. Place your songs in the `songs/` directory along with the required `info.json` file and `cover.jpg` for album artwork.

## ðŸ›  Issues and Fixes
### **Current Issues**
- The **previous** and **next** buttons are not updating the song index correctly.
- The index value is consistently returning `-1`, causing playback issues.

### **Possible Fix**
- Debug the index calculation with the following code snippet:
  ```javascript
  let index = songs.indexOf(decodeURIComponent(currentsongs.src.split("/").slice(-1)[0]));
  ```
- Ensure `decodeURIComponent()` is properly used to match URL encoding.
- Log the `songs` array and `currentsongs.src` to verify correct indexing.

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
- Improve **UI responsiveness** for mobile and tablet devices.
- Implement **custom playlist creation** for personalized music selection.
- Integrate **real-time song lyrics display** for an enhanced user experience.
- Add **dark mode toggle** for user preference customization.
